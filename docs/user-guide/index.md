# Use the service to update your capital schemes 

This section outlines how you can use the service to view and update your capital schemes.

## View your schemes

Once signed into the service you will see your schemes. This shows all active and incomplete ATF schemes submitted 
by your authority that you can provide updates on:

![Your schemes](schemes.png)

If you have schemes that need reviewing then a notification banner will be shown. This will say how long you have 
left to provide updates until the end of the reporting month.

Individual schemes that need reviewing will have a “Needs review” tag alongside them. To view or update a scheme you 
can click the scheme reference.

\pagebreak

## View a scheme

After clicking a scheme reference you will see details for the scheme:

![Scheme details](scheme.png)

If the scheme needs reviewing then a message prompting a review will be shown. 

Scheme details are separated into separate cards:

* Overview
* Funding
* Milestones
* Outputs

Changes can be made to spend to date and milestone dates by clicking “Change” alongside these items. See the 
following sections for details. 

\pagebreak

## Change spend to date

After clicking “Change” in a scheme's funding card you will be able to update how much has been spent to date:

![Change spend to date](change-spend-to-date.png)

\pagebreak

## Change milestone dates

After clicking “Change” in a scheme's milestones card you will be able to update planned and actual dates for each 
milestone:

![Change milestone dates](change-milestone-dates.png)

Revise the dates as necessary and click “Confirm” to submit the change.

## Review a scheme

Once you have confirmed that the details for a scheme are all up-to-date, tick the checkbox and click the “Confirm” 
button:
